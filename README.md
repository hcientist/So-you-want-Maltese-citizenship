## Argument for Citizenship

Note: 
  > "the appointed day" means 21st September 1964;

1. Nana was born in 1924.
2. She was "automatically" a `citizen by birth` according to <cite><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://komunita.gov.mt/en/services/acquisition-of-citizenship/">Acquisition of Citizenship by Birth</a></cite>
    > Who automatically became a citizen of Malta with Malta’s Independence?
    >
    > Persons who were:
    > 
    > Born in Malta before 21stSeptember 1964 and at least one of their parents was born in Malta; ...
    * but actually, that website is a bit murky. [here's the document](https://legislation.mt/eli/cap/188/eng/pdf)
        * Chapter 188, (Part 1) Article 3, Sub-article 1
            > Every person who, having been born in Malta, was on the day before the appointed day a citizen of the United Kingdomand Colonies, shall be deemed to have acquired Maltese citizenship on the appointed day:
            > 
            > Provided that a person shall not be deemed to have becomea citizen of Malta by virtue of this subarticle if neither of his parents was born in Malta:
            > 
            > Provided further that the person mentioned in the precedingproviso who proves that he is a descendant in the direct line of anascendant born in Malta of a parent likewise born in Malta shall beentitled, upon making an application as may be prescribed and upontaking the oath of allegiance, to be registered as a citizen of Malta. Theprovisions of sub-articles (4), (5) (6) and (7) shall apply mutatismutandis.
        * This doesn't sound all that "automatic" to me?
3. Dad was maybe also "automatically" (retroactively) a citizen by birth?
    * Chapter 188, (Part 2) Article 5, Sub-article 2
        > A person born outside Malta on or after the appointed day shall be deemed to have become or shall become a citizen of Maltaat the date of his birth:
        >
        > (a) in the case of a person born on or before the 31st July, 1989, if at the date of such person’s birth, his father was a citizen of Malta otherwise than by virtue of this subarticle or article 3(2):
        >
        > Provided that a person born on or before the 31st July, 1989, if at the date of such person’s birth his mother was a citizen of Malta otherwise than by virtue of this subarticle or article 3(2) shall be entitled, upon making an application as may be prescribed and upon taking the oath of allegiance, to be registered as acitizen of Malta; and
        

Then there's this on the consulate:
  > A descendant in the direct line of an ascendant born in Malta of a parent likewise born in Malta, would need to submit:
  >
  > A full birth certificate of the applicant (showing the parents' names);
  > 
  > The applicant's marriage certificate (if applicable);
  > 
  > One recent passport-sized photo of the applicant;
  > 
  > The applicant's passport;
  > 
  > The birth and marriage certificates of the applicant’s ascendants to show the direct link to two consecutive generations of ascendants born in Malta;
  > 
  > In case of the third and subsequent generations:
  > The death certificate of the applicant's ascendant/s born in Malta (in case of death); and
  > Copy of the registration certificate of the applicant's ascendant/s born in Malta (as applicable)
